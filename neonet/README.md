# NeoNet dataset sample

[NeoNet (https://github.com/zoometh/neonet) is a research software for dynamic mapping of radiocarbon (C14) dates of the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic transition in the North-Central Mediterranean and South Atlantic European river basin. 

* The [R Shiny app](http://shinyserver.cfs.unipi.it:3838/C14/) offers a mobile geographic window for date selection by location, various filters on chronology and date quality, a calibration window, and other tools to create a user-friendly interface supported by a curated dataset of radiocarbon dates and archaeological contexts;

* The [published dataset](https://digitallib.unipi.it/it/raccolta/The-NeoNet-dataset-version-1.-A-new-dataset-of-radiocarbon-dates-for-the-study-of-the-Late-Mesolithic-Early-Neolithic-transition-in-the-North-Central-Western-Mediterranean-watershed./) counts ~ 2,500 radiocarbon dates with their archaeological context (site, layer, associated culture, etc.)
